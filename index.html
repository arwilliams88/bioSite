	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>Brianna was born and raised here in Bellevue, Nebraska and just turned 24 years old (she is old now apparently according to her) this past September. She has one older sister (Me!), a younger sister Michaela who is 18 years old, and a younger brother Jonathan who is 19 years old</p>
	
	<p>Our younger years consisted of us growing up together as a multigenerational household. Our mother has been a single mom for most of the time she raised us and from the time Brianna was born until about the time she was around seven we lived together with our Grandparents. Also, at the same time our uncle and cousins lived with us as well so that house had two grandparents, our uncle, our mother, and five children.</p>
	
	<p>I think this definitely helped to shape her into the person she is today. She enjoys spending her time reading manga, watching anime, playing video games, and spending time with family. Brianna Is currently in school pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design at UNO and has already received her Associate’s Degree in Graphic Design from Metropolitan Community College. She should be done with school sometime in 2020.</p>

	<h2>Future</h2>
	
	<p>In the future Brianna plans to use her Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design to pursue freelance work in her field. One of her first goals is to move out on her own and start to see the world. She has never lived on her own so this would be a huge step for her. One of her big goals as well would be to visit Japan!</p>
